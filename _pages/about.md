Greetings! I am currently an Analyst at Goldman Sachs, where I work on designing, implementing and validating mission critical real time datastreaming systems for the Compliance Division for trade restrictions across the firm. I am currently working on designing a stream synchronization architecture using write ahead logs and stateful stream processing in Apache Flink. Prior to this I spent a beautiful 8 months as a Visiting Scholar at the KISP Lab, National University of Singapore, collaborating with [Prof. Prateek Saxena](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~prateeks/). My research revolved around Machine Learning Security and Cryptography. 

I recently graduated from Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani, India with a B.E. in Computer Science. My undergrad years were spent exploring the puzzling world math and computer science brought. I worked on problems in statistical physics, NLP, graph theory and many more things (The highlight would be working alongside the guy who made Stephen Hawking's speech software!!). During my undergrad, I had the pleasure of working with amazing researchers like Dr. Srikanth Sastry, Dr. Shravan Hanasoge and Dr. Mukund Thattai as an intern at the prestigous Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR), Mumbai on Reinforcement Learning for Inverse problems in Self Assembly.
